# Lab | Unsupervised learning intro

#### Instructions 

he experiments you did with the `Spotify` API and the Billboard web scraping will allow you to create a pipeline such that when the user enters a song, you:

1. Check whether or not the song is in the Billboard Hot 200.
2. Collect the audio features from the `Spotify` API.

After that, you want to send the `Spotify` audio features of the submitted song to the clustering model, which should return a cluster number.

We want to have as many songs as possible to create the clustering model, so we will add the songs you collected to a bigger dataset available on Kaggle containing 160 thousand songs.


. In this Project called "GNOD Project", I created an Song Search engine from Spotify API.
. In the project you would be able to upload a CSV file with song features from spotify and a column with a name song, and then the function would be able to give you a recomended
  song if the song that you want to search doesn't appear in the CSV file.
